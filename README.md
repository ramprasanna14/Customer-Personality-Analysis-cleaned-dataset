# Customer-Personality-Analysis-cleaned-dataset
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a companyâ€™s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers. 
I have cleaned this dataset using EDA and also created some new features useful for further data analysis.
